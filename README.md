# Appium Framework

The project contains a framework for running Appium. The baseFramework branch contains a mostly blank framework with 1 example test in each platform. The testingFramework branch contains more detailed testing examples to work from. Both contain detailed comments throughout the code. 

The Framework was made using IntelliJ on MacOS, so file path's mentioned in code may need to be adjusted

## Installation

### Requirements:

1. Typical IntelliJ setup for TestNG including Java, Maven, Selenium, TestNG, Node.js (dependencies should already be in the pom.xml file) etc.
    a. Currently the pom.xml file uses the following versions: Appium 7.5.1, Selenium 3.141.59, TestNG 7.4.0, Maven Surefire 3.0.0-M5
    b. If you have newer versions, update the version numbers in the pom.xml. Then right click on the pom.xml > Maven > Reload Project to load the dependencies 
3. Appium installation - I recommend the desktop client
4. XCode Installation (set up your preferred simulator)
5. Android Studio Installation (set up your preferred emulator)
6. If doing testing on desktop browsers, insure they are installed. Safari will require you to allow automation within the developer menu (enabled in advanced settings)

### Steps

Note: a great guide on Git exists at https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

1. Create a new repository in github for your project
2. Navigate to the repository. The page should be focused on Quick Setup and the bottom section should say "...or import code from another repository". Click "Import Code"
3. Paste in https://github.com/madison-vincent/DemoAppiumFramework.git and click "Begin Import"
5. The new repository should now be a copy of the Demo framework
6. Open the IDE and create a new project based on a Verified Code Source (Get form VCS on IntelliJ). Provide the URL to your new repository
7. Switch to the repo branch you want to view/work in. Run the following command (Replace baseFramework with testingFramework to checkout the branch with example tests):
 git checkout baseFramework
 git pull baseFramework
 8. The code should be in place, as a check you can ensure that classes exist in src>main>java>com.Framework>Base
 9. Right click on the pom.xml > Maven > Reload Project
 10. Naviage to src>main>java>com.Framework>global.properties and open the file 
 11. Follow the provided instructions to update the fields where needed. e.g. provide your project name, IP address, etc.
 12. You can replace the app files with your desired files and update the app file names in Global Properties accordingly
 13.  ****** CREATE TESTNG FILE ****************

## Usage

### Running Tests

1. Ensure Android Studio and Xcode are open. 
2. Open the simulator/emulator in both locations. They must be open for Appium to recognize them. If a physical device is plugged in it will likely use that, but the global properties file may still need to be updated to include the right device name and id
3. Ensure the Appium server is running
4. You should now be able to run tests. It should default to running using TestNG. 
5. Test output will appear in the IDE as well as the Appium Server logs. 

### Test Reports

Several reports will be generated automatically once tests have been ran that have failed/passed. They can be access by right clicking the report > Open In > Browser > Select browser. They are found at the following locations:

Emailable Report: Detailed report with screenshots
test-output > emailable-report.html

Basic Report: Simple overall report without screenshots
test-output > index.html

ExtentReport: Visually pleasing and includes graphs, dashboard etc
test-output > Reports > htmlreport.html

I would recommend the Emailable Report when debugging as it includes the most detail as well as screenshots captured upon failed assertions
